# HospitalFinder_AndroidApp
Hospitals provide health care and are the largest and most complex organizations. Effective patient care services in hospitals depend on efficient decisions made by hospital executives. The primary task of hospital executives is to ensure the hospital can provide high-quality patient care and services. But, during medical emergencies, people often have difficulty deciding which hospital to visit for treatment. They wander from one hospital to another in search of medical facilities, medicines, blood supply, etc. Hospital Finder is a solution to this problem. It allows people to search for nearby hospitals based on medical treatment, specialist doctors, medicine/blood availability, and other factors. The proposed application is developed that locates the nearest hospital about five km radius with the desired medical specialist. The nearest position of hospital is calculated with a built in feature of Global Positioning System (GPS) in Smartphones and finds the route from their current location through Google map program Interfaces (API).
